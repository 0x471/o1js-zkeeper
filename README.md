# zKeeper

A Mina-based ZK-rollup ensuring private transactions by mixing them ðŸŒª

This project leverages Mina to implement a ZK-rollup solution known as Appchain Mixer. Its primary function is to facilitate private transactions while seamlessly integrating KYC/AML systems. By utilizing zero-knowledge proofs on Mina, users can conduct secure and compliant transactions with enhanced privacy features.

[o1js](#), with its cryptographic capabilities, plays a pivotal role in implementing zero-knowledge proofs, enhancing privacy and security. [Next.js](#), being a React framework, contributes to the project's frontend, ensuring a modular and efficient user interface. [Protokit](#) serves developers to build zero-knowledge, interoperable, and privacy-preserving application chains.

## Mission

ZK appchain rollup on top of Mina. Providing private transactions with KYC/AML on Mina.

## Potential Use Cases 
- Private donations, crowdfunding
- Private token staking
- Data monetization
- Cross-chain ZK DeFi ;p
- Privacy-focused social platforms

## Challenges
- Lack of documentation, examples....

## Vision
- Providing private transfers from Mina to Ethereum and L2s (Starknet, zkSync, Optimism, etc.) by using LambdaClass Mina bridge and storage proofs (Herodotus)
- Not only native tokens but also providing custom tokens.
